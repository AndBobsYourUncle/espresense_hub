/**
 * A directed adjacency map keyed by room id. Symmetric by construction —
 * every edge (A, B) is mirrored as (B, A) — so `graph.get(a)?.has(b)` is a
 * constant-time "can a person walk from A directly to B" check.
 *
 * Edges come from two config sources, both treated as "human-passable":
 *
 *   1. `open_to` entries on a room — explicit door / open passage. Entries
 *      may reference a real room *or* the well-known `OUTSIDE_ROOM_ID`
 *      ("outside"), which marks an exterior door.
 *   2. `floor_area` groupings — every room sharing the same tag forms a
 *      fully-connected subgraph. Models open-plan layouts where
 *      kitchen/dining/living have no walls between them.
 *
 * Notably *excludes* the auto-detected "shared polygon edge" that
 * `RoomAwareLocator` uses for trust weighting. A shared wall is NOT a
 * walkable transition — the user explicitly declares doors via `open_to`.
